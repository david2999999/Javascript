// Here, the function add() defi nes a local variable named sum that contains the result of an addition
// operation. This value is returned as the function value, but the variable sum isnâ€™t accessible outside

// Here, the variable sum is initialized to a value without ever having been declared using var. When
// add() is called, sum is created in the global context and continues to exist even after the function
// has completed, allowing you to access it later
