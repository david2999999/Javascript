    The main purpose of this format was to keep external fi le references, both CSS fi les and JavaScript
    files, in the same area. However, including all JavaScript fi les in the <head> of a document means
    that all of the JavaScript code must be downloaded, parsed, and interpreted before the page begins
    rendering (rendering begins when the browser receives the opening <body> tag). For pages that
    require a lot of JavaScript code, this can cause a noticeable delay in page rendering, during which
    time the browser will be completely blank. For this reason, modern web applications typically include
    all JavaScript references in the <body> element, after the page content, as shown in this example:
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Example HTML Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <!-- content here -->
        <script type=”text/javascript” src=”example1.js”></script>
        <script type=”text/javascript” src=”example2.js”></script>
    </body>
</html>
