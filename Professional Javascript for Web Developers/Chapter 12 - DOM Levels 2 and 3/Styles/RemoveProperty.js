// The removeProperty() method is used to remove a specifi c CSS property from the elementâ€™s
// styling. Removing a property using this method means that any default styling for that property
// (cascading from other style sheets) will be applied. For instance, to remove a border property that
// was set in the style attribute,
myDiv.style.removeProperty('border');
