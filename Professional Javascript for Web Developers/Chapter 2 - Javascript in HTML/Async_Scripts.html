    HTML5 introduces the async attribute for <script> elements. The async attribute is similar to defer
    in that it changes the way the script is processed. Also similar to defer, async applies only to external
    scripts and signals the browser to begin downloading the fi le immediately. Unlike defer, scripts
    marked as async are not guaranteed to execute in the order in which they are specified.
