// The last method is forEach(), which simply runs the given function on every item in an array. There
// is no return value and is essentially the same as iterating over an array using a for loop.

var numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1];

numbers.forEach(function(item, index, array){
    //do something here
});
