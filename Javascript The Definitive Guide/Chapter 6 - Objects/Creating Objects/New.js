// The new operator creates and initializes a new object. The new keyword must be followed
// by a function invocation. A function used in this way is called a constructor and serves
// to initialize a newly created object. Core JavaScript includes built-in constructors for
// native types
var o = new Object(); // Create an empty object: same as {}.
var a = new Array(); // Create an empty array: same as [].
var d = new Date(); // Create a Date object representing the current time
var r = new RegExp("js"); // Create a RegExp object for pattern matching.
