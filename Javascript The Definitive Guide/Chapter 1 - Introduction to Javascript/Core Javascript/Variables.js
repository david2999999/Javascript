// variable is a symbolic name for a value.
// Variables are declared with the var keyword:

var x; // Declare a variable named x.
// Values can be assigned to variables with an = sign

x // => 0: A variable evaluates to its value.

// JavaScript supports several types of values
x = 1; // Numbers.
x = 0.01; // Just one Number type for integers and reals.
x = "hello world"; // Strings of text in quotation marks.
x = 'JavaScript'; // Single quote marks also delimit strings.
x = true; // Boolean values.
x = false; // The other Boolean value.
x = null; // Null is a special value that means "no value".
x = undefined; // Undefined is like null.
