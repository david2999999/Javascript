// One of the built-in features of JavaScript is the ability to concatenate strings. If you use
// the + operator with numbers, it adds them. But if you use this operator on strings, it
// joins them by appending the second to the first. For example:
msg = "Hello, " + "world"; // Produces the string "Hello, world"
greeting = "Welcome to my blog," + " " + name;
