// The conditional operator is the only ternary operator (three operands) in JavaScript
// and is sometimes actually called the ternary operator. This operator is sometimes written
//     ?:, although it does not appear quite that way in code. Because this operator has
// three operands, the first goes before the ?, the second goes between the ? and the :,
// and the third goes after the :. It is used like this:
x > 0 ? x : -x // The absolute value of x

// While you can achieve similar results using the if statement (ยง5.4.1), the ?: operator
// often provides a handy shortcut. Here is a typical usage, which checks to be sure that
// a variable is defined (and has a meaningful, truthy value) and uses it if so or provides
// a default value if not:
greeting = "hello " + (username ? username : "there");

// This is equivalent to, but more compact than, the following if statement:
// greeting = "hello ";
if (username)
    greeting += username;
else
    greeting += "there";
