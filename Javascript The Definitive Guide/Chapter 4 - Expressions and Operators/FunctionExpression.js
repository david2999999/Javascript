// A function definition expression defines a JavaScript function, and the value of such
// an expression is the newly defined function. In a sense, a function definition expression
// is a “function literal” in the same way that an object initializer is an “object literal.” A
// function definition expression typically consists of the keyword function followed by
// a comma-separated list of zero or more identifiers (the parameter names) in parentheses
// and a block of JavaScript code (the function body) in curly braces. For example:
// This function returns the square of the value passed to it.
var square = function(x) { return x * x; }
